Frank's uniqueness lies in the fact that he makes music purely for the joy of creating and because he wears a giant fake head. After a rocky start, Jon ingratiates himself with the band, and they retreat to a cabin in the woods to record an album. As his influence waxes, creative tensions mount and the band's entire raison d'etre is called into question.","critics_score":86,"audience_score":95,"directors":["Lenny Abrahamson"],"image_m":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/82/11178247_det.jpg","image_l":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/82/11178247_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frank_2014/","review_ids":["2bc2a"]}
