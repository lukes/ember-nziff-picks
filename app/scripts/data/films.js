Relationships among the three main characters - Earl Gray, Gentian Violet, and Victor Blue - multiply and divide as their stories becomes increasingly complex, hilarious, and scary. The Huffington Post writes of the film's \"insanely meticulous construction\" and continues: \"The animation took 15 years of work... The characters were hand-drawn onto layers of glass which were then moved with needles and pins. The film seamlessly combines cutout animation, pencil drawing, collage, and stop-motion animation to create the haunting atmosphere of a self-contained world... (most of whose) characters walk shakily between self-medication and a bad trip... ugly characters (who) make up the most beautiful spectacle you've ever seen.\"","critics_score":89,"audience_score":73,"directors":["Chris Sullivan"],"image_m":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167956_det.jpg","image_l":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/79/11167956_ori.jpg","rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/consuming_spirits/","reviews":["ba4df","95a96"]},{"id":771306928,"title":"Jimi: All Is by My Side","year":2013,"genres":["Drama"],"runtime":"","synopsis":"Andre 3000 steps into the role of Jimi Hendrix in this biopic focusing on the iconic rocker's recording of his Are You Experienced album. ~ Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi","critics_score":89,"audience_score":0,"directors":[],"rt_link":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jimi_all_is_by_my_side/","reviews":["6cb23"]},{"id":"771355914","title":"The Congress","year":2013,"runtime":122,"synopsis":"Directed by Ari Folman (Oscar (R)-nominated Waltz With Bashir), starring Robin Wright (\"House Of Cards\"; The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), Jon Hamm (AMC's \"Mad Men\"), Paul Giamatti (Sideways; John Dies At The End) and Harvey Keitel (Taxi Driver; Bad Lieutenant), The Congress blends live-action and psychedelic animation as an aging, out-of-work actress (Wright playing an alternate reality version of herself) accepts her final job: preserving her digital image for a future Hollywood.
